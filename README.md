# InternshipKnowledge

A blog style website showing the things I have learned during this internship.

### Update day 1 - initial coding

After reading some resources about stuff a junior developer should know. I thought it would be good to have somewhere to keep this information as well as keep any future plans related to it.
So this will be where that all goes. 

The plan for today is to get some basic structuring of the website up.
