            Welcome to my website! My name is Mark and I am an aspiring software
            developer. I have self taught myself the basics of web development,
            learning HTML, CSS, and JS.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was fortunate enough to get an internship as a frontend developer.
            As I work I learn a lot more things, and still strive to keep
            learning on the side.
          </p>
          <p>
            This website will showcase my learning journey as I become a better
            programmer.
